Abstract
Despite citation counts from Google Scholar (GS), Web of Science (WoS), and Scopus being widely 
consulted by researchers and sometimes used in research evaluations, there is no recent or 
systematic evidence about the differences between them. In response, this paper investigates 
2,448,055 citations to 2,299 English-language highly-cited documents from 252 GS subject categories 
published in 2006, comparing GS, the WoS Core Collection, and Scopus. GS consistently found the 
largest percentage of citations across all areas (93%-96%), far ahead of Scopus (35%-77%) and WoS 
(27%-73%). GS found nearly all the WoS (95%) and Scopus (92%) citations. Most citations found only 
by GS were from non-journal sources (48%-65%), including theses, books, conference papers, and 
unpublished materials. Many were non-English (19%- 38%), and they tended to be much less cited than 
citing sources that were also in Scopus or WoS. Despite the many unique GS citing sources, Spearman 
correlations between citation counts in GS and WoS or Scopus are high (0.78-0.99). They are lower 
in the Humanities, and lower between GS and WoS than between GS and Scopus. The results suggest 
that in all areas GS citation data is essentially a superset of WoS and Scopus, with substantial 
extra coverage.

1. Introduction
The launch of Google Scholar (GS) in November of 2004 brought the simplicity of Google searches to 
the academic environment, and revolutionized the way researchers and the public searched, found, 
and accessed academic information. Until that point, the coverage of academic databases depended on 
lists of selected sources (usually scientific journals). In contrast, and using automated methods, 
Google Scholar crawled the web and indexed any document with a seemingly academic structure. This 
inclusive approach gave GS potentially more comprehensive coverage of the scientific and scholarly 
literature compared to the two major existing multidisciplinary databases with selective 
journal-based inclusion policies, the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus (Orduna-Malea, Ayllén, 
Martin-Martin, & Delgado Lépez-Cozar, 2015).

Although citation data in Google Scholar was originally intended to be a means of identifying the 
most relevant documents for a given query, it could also be used for formal or informal research 
evaluations. The availability of free citation data in Google Scholar, together with the free 
software Publish or Perish (Harzing, 2007) to gather it made citation analysis possible without a 
citation database subscription (Harzing & van der Wal, 2008). Nevertheless, GS has not enabled bulk 
access to its data, reportedly because their agreements with publishers preclude it (Van Noorden, 
2014). Thus, third-party web-scraping software is currently the only practical way to extract more 
data from GS than permitted by Publish or Perish.

Despite its known errors and limitations, which are consequence of its automated approach to 
document indexing (Delgado Lépez-Cozar, Robinson-Garcia, & Torres-Salinas, 2014; Jacso, 2010), GS 
has been shown to be reliable and to have good coverage of disciplines and languages, especially in 
the Humanities and Social Sciences, where WoS and Scopus are known to be weak (Chavarro, Râfols, & 
Tang, 2018; Mongeon & Paul-Hus, 2016; van Leeuwen, Moed, Tijssen, Visser, & Van Raan, 2001). 
Analyses of the coverage of GS, WoS, and Scopus across disciplines have compared the numbers of 
publications indexed or their average citation counts for samples of documents, authors, or 
journals, finding that GS consistently returned higher numbers of publications and citations 
(Harzing, 2013; Harzing & Alakangas, 2016; Mingers & Lipitakis, 2010; Prins, Costas, van Leeuwen, & 
Wouters, 2016). Citation counts from a range of different sources have been shown to correlate 
positively with GS citation counts at various levels of aggregation (Amara & Landry, 2012; De 
Groote & Raszewski, 2012; Delgado Lopez-Cozar, Orduna-Malea, & Martin-Martin, 2018; Kousha & 
Thelwall, 2007; Martin-Martin, Orduna-Malea, & Delgado Lopez-Cozar, 2018; Meho & Yang, 2007; 
Minasny, Hartemink, McBratney, & Jang, 2013; Moed, Bar-llan, & Halevi, 2016; Pauly & Stergiou, 
2005; Rahimi & Chandrakumar, 2014; Wildgaard, 2015). See the supplementary materials 4, Delgado 
Lépez-Cozar et al. (2018), Orduña-Malea, Martin-Martin, Ayllon, & Delgado Lopez-Cozar (2016), and 
Halevi, Moed, & Bar- IIan (2017) for discussions of the wider strengths and weaknesses of GS.

A key issue is the ability of GS, WoS, and Scopus to find citations to documents, and the extent to 
which they index citations that the others cannot find. The results of prior studies are confusing, 
however, because they have examined different small (with one exception) sets of articles. A 
summary of the results found in these previous studies is presented in Table 1. For example, the 
number of citations that are unique to GS varies between 13% and 67%, with the differences probably 
being due to the study year or the document types or disciplines covered. The only 
multidisciplinary study (Moed et al., 2016) checked articles in 12 journals from 6 subject areas, 
which is still a limited set.

The fields previously compared for citation sources (Table 1) are Library and Information Science 
(5 out of 10 articles analyse case studies about LIS documents/journals/researchers), Medicine (3 
papers, analysing oncology, general medicine, and dentistry), Physics (2 articles: general and 
condensed matter), Chemistry (2 articles: general and inorganic), Computer Science (2 articles: 
general, and computational linguistics), Biology (2 articles: general, and virology), Social Work, 
Political Science, and Chinese Studies (1 article each). From this list it is clear that most 
academic fields have not been analysed for Google Scholar coverage. The studies used small samples 
of documents and citations (9 out of 10 papers analysed less than 10,000 citations), probably 
because of the difficulty of extracting data from GS, caused by the lack of a public API (Else, 
2018; Van Noorden, 2014). Moreover, the most recent data in these studies was collected in 2015 
(three years before the current study), and the oldest data is from 2005 (13 years ago).

Given the limited nature of all prior studies of citing sources for GS and the need to update all 
previous research, a comprehensive analysis of citation sources in GS, WoS, and Scopus across all 
subject areas is needed. This information is important for those deciding whether to use GS 
citation counts for informal or formal research evaluations. The following research questions drive 
this investigation.

RQ1.  How much overlap is there between GS, WoS, and Scopus in the citations that they find to 
academic documents and does this vary by subject?

RQ2.  Do the citing documents that are only found by GS have a different type to non-unique GS 
citations, and does this vary by subject?

RQ3.  How similar are citation counts in GS to those found in WoS and Scopus, at the level of 
subjects?

2. Methods
The sample used for this study is taken from GS's Classic Papers product (GSCP)5. The 2017 edition 
of GSCP lists 2,515 highly-cited documents written in English and published in 20066. These 
documents were classified by GS into 252 subject categories within 8 broad subject areas. 
Background about GSCP can be found in Orduna-Malea, Martin-Martin, & Delgado Lopez-Cozar (2018) and 
Martin-Martin, Orduna-Malea, & Delgado Lopez-Cozar (2018). This gives a large sample of highly 
cited documents classified by subject. This is not a random sample of academic publications because 
there is no complete list of these. There is also not a complete list of documents in GS.

The GSCP sample is suitable because it covers all subject areas and, because the articles are 
classified, allows analyses by subject categories. GSCP and Google Scholar Metrics' (GSM) are the 
only products where GS provides a subject categorization. Taking a sample from one of the three 
sources to be compared (GS, Scopus, WoS) is not ideal because it is likely to bias the results in 
favour of GS. Nevertheless, the inclusion of 252 categories minimizes the chance of bias due to a 
subject area that is not well covered by GS. GS is also a better source than WoS or Scopus because 
of its more comprehensive coverage, as found by most prior studies.


2.1. Extraction of data from Google Scholar
The citations to each of the 2,515 GSCP documents were extracted from GS, WoS, and Scopus between 
April 22nd and May 6 h, 2018. A custom script scraped all the relevant information from GS SERPs 
(Search Engine Results Pages) (Figure 1). Searches were submitted from

subscribers (Clarivate Analytics, 2015). CAPTCHAs were solved manually when GS requested them. This 
process found 2,415,072 citations in Google Scholar to the 2,515 highly- cited documents. The 
number of citations is reduced to 2,301,997 for the 2,299 highly-cited documents also covered by 
WoS and Scopus.

the web, on sites that allow users to tag bookmarks, photographs and other content. In this
paper we analyze the structure of collaborative tagging systems as well as their dynamic aspects. 
Specifically, we discovered regularities in user activity, tag frequencies, kinds of tags used,

The data was processed to clean and enrich the limited metadata available in GS, as follows.

•  DOI were detected for as many citing documents as possible. The following techniques were used, 
retrieving 1,501,178 DOIs (62%).
a  Extracted from URLs for publishers like Wiley, Springer, and SAGE which embed the DOI in the 
article's landing page URL (Figure 1, #2).

metadata.
•  Metadata was obtained from CrossRef and DataCite APIs when a DOI was available or otherwise from 
HTML Meta tags present in the website hosting the citation, when possible.
2.2. Extraction of data from Web of Science and Scopus
Each of the 2,515 highly-cited documents in GSCP was searched for in the WoS (Core Collection) web 
interface. The list of citations to each document was extracted (in batches of up to 500

8 https://osf.io/qg8kb/ https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-delivery/rest-api/

5

records per download). The exported files were consolidated into a single table using a set of R 
functions developed for this purpose (Martin-Martin & Delgado Lopez-Cézar, 2016). Although R has 
built-in functions and additional libraries to read tabulated data, none of them seemed to work 
with data exported from WoS. A total of 1,270,225 WoS records were collected 10. At the time of 
data collection FECYT 11, the Spanish organization that manages the national subscription to 
Clarivate Analytics' services, had not subscribed to the Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) 
Backfile for documents published between 2005 and 2014 (Clarivate Analytics, 2017), and so the 
results exclude this source.

Each of the 2,515 highly-cited documents in GSCP were also searched for in the Scopus web 
interface. This has a limit of 2,000 records when exporting citations. When a highly-cited document 
had more than 2,000 citations, these could still be extracted using the alternative email service, 
which allows the extraction of up to 20,000 citation records in one go. A total 1,515,436 Scopus 
records were collected 12.

Most of the highly-cited documents (2,299 out of 2,515) were covered by all three databases, and 
the citations to these 2,299 documents are analysed here.
2.3. Identification of document types and languages of citing documents
Unlike WoS and Scopus, GS does not provide metadata on the document type and the language of the 
documents that it covers. The metadata extracted from CrossRef's API and HTML Meta tags of the 
hosting website gave this information for 83% of the citing documents. Adding metadata from WoS and 
Scopus increased this percentage to 85%. The following categories were used.

•  Journal publication: article, review, letter, editorial...
•  Conference paper: paper presented at conference, symposium, workshop, society meeting...
•  Book or book chapter: scientific/scholarly monograph
•  Thesis or dissertation: document presented by student to fulfill the requirements of a doctoral, 
masters', or bachelor's degree
•  Other not-formally-published scientific/scholarly paper: working paper, discussion paper, other 
paper for which no formal publication venue could be found.
•  Other: report, patent, presentation slides, syllabus, educational materials, errata...
•  Unknown: document for which no document type could be identified

To identify the distribution of document types in the 15% for which metadata was not available, 
eight random samples of 500 citing documents with an unknown document type were selected, one for 
each of the broad subject categories in which GSCP are classified. The document types of these 
4,000 citing documents were manually identified by accessing and perusing the full text of the 
documents (when possible) or the available metadata. The proportion of document types found in 
these random samples were applied as a correction factor to the percentage of citations with an 
unknown document type in each broad subject area. For example, in the Social Sciences, 33.5% of the 
citing documents were classified as journal articles using the available metadata, but 20% of all 
citing documents could not be classified with the available metadata. A random sample of documents 
from that unknown 20% were selected and analyzed manually, finding that 27.6% of the items in the 
random sample were journal articles. Therefore, the total percentage of journal articles in Social 
Sciences was 33.5% + (27.6% of 20% = 5.5%) = 39%.

The language of 98% of the citing documents was identified by combining data from three sources (in 
the order of preference shown below).

1. Metadata in CrossRef and HTML Meta tags.
2. Metadata in WoS (Scopus did not provide document language information).
3. Google's Compact Language Detector 213 applied to the document title.

For RQ1, the citations extracted from GS, WoS and Scopus were matched as follows. Three pairwise 
matching processes were carried out: GS—Scopus; GS—WoS; and Scopus—WoS.

1. For each pair of databases A and B, and a highly-cited document from GSCP X, all citing 
documents with a DOI that cite X according to A where matched to all citing documents with a DOI 
that cite X according to B.
2. For each of the unmatched documents citing X in A and B, a further comparison was carried out. 
The title of each unmatched document citing X in A was compared to the titles of all the unmatched 
document citing X in B, using the restricted Damerau- Levenshtein distance (optimal string 
alignment) (Damerau, 1964; Levenshtein, 1966). The pair of citing documents which returned the 
highest title similarity (1 is perfect similarity) was selected as potential matches. This match 
was considered successful if either of the following conservative heuristics was met.
o  The title similarity was at least 0.8, and the citing document title was at least 30 characters 
long (to avoid matches between titles like “Introduction").
a  The title similarity was at least 0.7, and the first author of the citing document was the same 
in A and B.

For RQ2, the document types, languages, and citation counts of the citing documents in our sample 
(see Figure 2) were aggregated or averaged by GSCP broad subject areas, differentiating between 
unique GS citations and overlapping citations.

For RQ3, Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for the citation counts of the citing 
documents in our sample (GS-WoS, and GS-Scopus), by subject category. Correlation coefficients are 
considered useful in high-level exploratory analyses to check whether different indicators reflect 
the same underlying causes (Sud & Thelwall, 2014). In this case, however, the goal is to find out 
whether the same indicator, based on different data sources, provides similar relative values. 
Spearman correlations were used because it is well-known that the distributions of citation counts 
and other impact-related metrics are highly skewed (De Solla Price, 1976). For the GS-WoS 
comparison, WoS subject categories and (for an additional check) the NOWT classification (Tijssen 
et al., 2010) were used. For the GS-Scopus comparison, the ASJC (All Science Journal 
Classification) available in the Scopus source list (Elsevier, 2018) was used.

To carry out all these processes, the R programming language (R Core Team, 2014), and several R 
packages and custom functions were used (Dowle et al., 2018; Larsson et al., 2018; Martin- Martin & 
Delgado Lopez-Cozar, 2016; Ooms & Sites, 2018; van der Loo, van der Laan, R Core Team, Logan, & 
Muir, 2018; Walker & Braglia, 2018; Wickham, 2016). The resulting data files are openly available

3. Results
3.1. RQ1: Citing source overlap
Overall, 46.9% of all citations were found by the three databases (Figure 3). GS found the most 
citations, including most of the citations found by WoS and Scopus. In contrast, only 6% of all 
citations were found by WoS and/or Scopus, and not by GS. An additional 10.2% of all citations were 
found by both GS and Scopus (7.7%), or GS and WoS (2.5%). Over a third (36.9%) of all citations 
were only found by GS.

When citations are disaggregated by the broad subject area in which the cited document was 
classified according to GSCP, important differences emerge (Figure 4). In Humanities, Literature & 
Ads, Social Sciences, and Business, Economics & Management the proportion of unique GS citations is 
well over 50% of all citations, surpassing 60% in the case of Business, Economics & Management. In 
these categories the proportion of citations found by all three databases ranges from 21.4% 
(Humanlties, Literature & Ads) to 29.8% (Social Sciences). On the other hand, in Engineering & 
Computer Science, Physics & Mathematics, Health & Medical Sciences, Life Sciences & Earth Sciences, 
and Chemical & Material Sciences, the proportion of unique GS citations is much lower (20.3% - 
34.3%), and the overlap is higher: percentages of citations found by all three databases range from 
46.8% (Engineering & Computer Science) to 67.7% (Chemical & Material Sciences).

For the 252 specific subject categories (data and figures for each category are available in the 
supplementary materials 15 ), there are more extreme differences (Figure 5). The highest 
percentages of unique citations in GS (over 70% of all citations) are found in Educational 
Administration1^, Foreign Language Learning 1’, Chinese Studies & History’8, and Finance 19. On the

The results for the 252 specific subject categories (available in the supplementary materials 24) 
show that GS covers at least 90% of all citations in 233 out of 252 categories, the lowest value 
being 77% in Visual Arts*’, and the highest values around 98% in Crystallography & Structural 
Chemistry*6, Evolutionary Biology*’, Quantum Mechanics*8, and Astronomy & Astrophysics*9. Relative 
to the coverage of WoS and Scopus, GS finds at least 90% of the citations that WoS and Scopus find 
in 221 and 164 categories, respectively, the lowest values belonging to the Humanities, such as 
Film’ , Visual Arts”, and History^* (56%-68%).
3.2. RQ2. Unique and non-unique citations
3.2.1. Document types

The distribution of document types of unique GS citations greatly differs from that of citations 
that were also found by WoS and/or Scopus. This is true across all eight broad subject categories 
(Figure 6). Among non-unique citations, the most common document type by far is the journal 
publication (from 71% in Engineering & Computer Science, to 94% in Chemical & Material Sciences). 
The other document types present among non-unique citations are books / book chapters and 
conference papers, with levels varying by subject area. Among unique GS citations, however, there 
is more document type diversity (including many never indexed by WoS or Scopus). Although journal 
publications are still the single most frequent document type, other document types comprise over 
50% in all subject areas except Health & Medical Sciences (48%). The most frequent non-journal 
document type is the thesis or dissertation (22% in Business,

Economics & Management — 37% in Chemical & Material Sciences), followed by books and book chapters 
(especially in Humanities, Literature & Arts and Social Sciences). This trend is different in 
Engineering & Computer Science, where conference papers are more common than books, and in 
Business, Economics & management and Physics & Mathematics, where unpublished scholarly papers 
(such as working papers and preprints) are also more frequently used than books for scientific 
communication.

Considering the 252 specific subject categories 33, the percentage of known document types other 
than journal articles in the unique GS citations ranges from approx. 10% in Nonlinear Science, 
Heart & Thoracic Surgery, Natural Medicines & Medicinal Plants, and Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, 
to over 55% in Special Education, and Computer Hardware & Design. However, unlike in the analysis 
by broad subject categories, a correction factor has not been applied (because no random samples 
were selected and analysed at this level), and therefore the document types of a large percentage 
of the citations are unknown (from approx. 20% in Special Education, and Ethnic & Cultural Studies, 
to over 50% in Quantum Mechanics, Geometry, and Algebra).

Figure 6. Distribution of document types among unique and overlapping citations in Google Scholar, 
by broad subject area of cited documents

Considering the citations found by WoS and/or Scopus which GS did not find (the citing document 
might be covered by GS without it making the connection between citing and cited document), most 
are from journals (Figure 7). Out of the 63,393 citations found by WoS and not by GS (5% of all 
citations), 41,052 (64% of the WoS citations that GS misses, or 3.2% of all citations analysed in 
this study) are from journals. Among citations from journal publications, there are more that were 
published in journals ranked in Q1 and Q4 of their respective JCR categories (0.9% and 1% of all 
citations), than in Q2 and Q3 (0.6% and 0.5%, respectively). The remaining missing citations come 
from books or book chapters (19% of WoS citations missing from GS, and 1% of all citations), and 
conference papers (15% of WoS citations missing from GS, and 0.8% of all citations). The 
proportions of Scopus citations missing from GS relative to the number of missing citations in GS 
(136,608) are very similar to those in WoS: 68% of journal publications, 19% books or book 
chapters, and 13% of conference papers. In this case, the proportion of Scopus citations missing 
from GS is 9%.

3.2.2. Languages

The distribution of languages among the unique GS citations is very different from that of non- 
unique citations (Figure 8). Whilst for non-unique citations nearly all documents (97%-100%) were 
published in English, for unique GS citations the percentage ranges from 62% (Health & Medical 
Sciences) to 80% (Humanities, Literature & Arts). This is even though a\\ documents in GSCP were 
published in English. The second most frequent language of unique GS citations was Chinese 
(4%-12%), and all other languages have a share of 4% or lower across all subject areas. A few 
(5%-10%) unique GS citations were published in languages outside the top 11 most frequently used 
languages overall (for all citations in our sample).

At the level of the 252 specific subject categories 34, the categories with a large proportion of 
non- English unique GS citations are Geochemistry & Mineralogy (59%), Surgery (56%), Radar, 
Positioning & Navigation (55%), and Cardiology (53%), whereas the categories with the lowest

3.2.3. Citation counts

This section analyses the Google Scholar citation counts of the 2,301,997 citing documents 
extracted from Google Scholar. The distributions of log-transformed (In(1+x) to reduce skewing) 
citation counts among unique GS citations, and overlapping citations (those also found by WoS 
and/or Scopus) are different (Figure 9). Across all subject areas, the median log-transformed 
citation count is always zero and lower than the median of log-transformed citation counts of non- 
unique citations. The 95% confidence interval for the mean (represented as a red box in Figure 9) 
is also significantly lower for unique GS citations than for non-unique citations. Both unique and 
non-unique citations include many outliers (blue dots in Figure 9). The same pattern occurs across 
the 252 specific subject categories 35, although there are 29 categories in which the median of the 
citation counts for the unique GS citations is higher than zero (but still lower than the median 
for overlapping citations).

3.3. RQ3. Citation count comparisons
Spearman correlations between citation counts (GS-WoS, GS-Scopus) are close to 1.0 in most subject 
categories (Table 3 and Table 4). Correlations between GS and WoS range from .78 in Literature, to 
.98 in Basic Life Sciences, Biomedical Sciences, Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, and 
Multidisciplinary journals. In 30 out of the 35 areas of research in the NOWT classification 
(Tijssen et al., 2010), the Spearman correlation coefficient is over .90. Correlations between 
Google Scholar and Scopus are even stronger. The weakest correlation is .92 in Economics, 
Econometrics, and Finance, and the strongest is .99 in Chemical Engineering, Immunology and 
Microbiology, and Multidisciplinary. In 20 out of 27 categories in the ASJC scheme, correlation 
coefficients are above .95. The supplementary materials contain tables of citation count 
correlations computed at the level of the 252 WoS subject categories 36, and the 330 ASJC low-level 
categories 37, which give broadly comparable results. The weakest statistically significant 
correlation between GS and WoS at this Ievel3 is in Medieval & Renaissance Studies (.69), while the 
weakest correlation between GS and Scopus 3 is .74 in Classics.

On average, GS finds more citations than WoS and Scopus across all categories (see mean citation 
ratios in Table 3 and Table 4). This effect holds even when citation counts are log- transformed 
(1+In(citations)) to reduce skewness. An inverse relationship between strength of correlation 
coefficients and mean citation ratios of GS over WoS/Scopus is observed. Strong correlation 
coefficients are associated with lower mean ratios, and vice versa.

4. Discussion
4.1. Limitations
This study analyses a large sample of citations to highly-cited documents from all subject areas 
published in English. In order to generalize the results to all articles, it must be assumed that 
the population of documents that cite highly cited articles is not significantly different from the 
general population of documents that cite articles. This may not be fully true since, for example, 
highly cited articles are presumably more likely to be in emerging research areas and larger 
specialisms. Furthermore, the results may not reflect the citation coverage (in GS, WoS, and 
Scopus) of documents that do not usually cite scientific literature written in English, such as 
documents that address locally or regionally relevant topics written in vernacular languages.

Because the highly-cited documents from which our sample of citations came were all initially 
selected from Google Scholar, this might have provided an advantage to GS in the comparisons: GS 
might be better suited than WoS or Scopus to find citations for these specific documents, for 
unknown reasons. Nevertheless, the high citation count correlations found in section 3.3 suggest 
that this advantage is not substantial, as the three databases provide essentially the same 
citation rankings at the document level in most subject categories.

Without access to Clarivate Analytics' recently created ESCI Backfile for documents published 
between 2005 and 2014, an unknown number of citations in this study are listed as found only by GS 
and/or Scopus, when they are also captured by ESCI. Thus, the results should not be interpreted as 
applying to all possible WoS data.

Additionally, this article describes a methodology to match citations in GS, WoS, and Scopus at the 
level of cited articles. The rules chosen to classify a potential match as successful were 
intentionally conservative to minimize false positives (citations that are matched by the 
algorithm, despite being different). The matching algorithm probably created some false negatives 
(citations not matched by the algorithm, despite being the same), especially in categories where 
DOIs are less widely used and the matching had to rely more frequently on strict title similarity 
rules. Thus, in some cases the percentages of unique citations might be lower, and percentages of 
overlaps higher, than reported here.
4.2. Comparison with previous studies
The data from previous studies (Table 1) reveal a growth over time in the coverage of citations in 
GS. While these studies reported that GS could find 38%-94% of all citations found by any source, 
depending on the discipline(s) of study and the sample analysed, the current study finds values 
that are higher and more consistent across subject areas. The results here are more similar to 
those of the most recent study (Moed et al., 2016) and least similar to the earliest studies 
(Bakkalbasi et al., 2006; Kousha & Thelwall, 2008; Meho & Yang, 2007; Yang & Meho, 2007). For 
example, GS found 94.3% of all citations to GSCP in Chemical & Material Sciences. Although not 
fully comparable, this figure greatly differs from the 38% of all Chemistry citations found by GS 
that Kousha & Thelwall (2008) reported. This is evidence that the citation coverage of GS has 
become much more comprehensive over time. On the other hand, the more recent study by Moed et al., 
(2016) found that GS contained 94% of all citations in their sample, which is the same as the 
current study.

The percentages of WoS and Scopus citations that GS could find are generally higher in the current 
study than previously reported. While prior studies varied greatly depending on the sample (33%-75% 
of WoS citations, and 44%-89% of Scopus citations), in the current paper GS found 88%-97% of WoS 
citations, and 84%-94% of Scopus citations (depending on the area). This high relative overlap is a 
partial cause of the high correlations for citation counts between GS and WoS, and GS and Scopus, 
found by Martin-Martin et al. (2018). Lastly, this study reports lower percentages of unique 
citations in WoS (up to 1.9% of all citations) and Scopus (up to 4.3%) than reported in previous 
studies (up to 23%⁴0 in WoS, and 12% in Scopus).


40 Considering studies that analysed the three databases (GS, WoS, and Scopus)

19

Regarding the distribution of document types and languages of GS unique citations, there were 
substantial percentages of theses and dissertations (from 22% in Business, Economics & Management, 
to 37% in Chemical & Material Sciences). These are larger than those found by Kousha & Thelwall 
(2008), Bar-llan (2010), and Lasda Bergman (2012), which found that up to 14% of GS unique 
citations belonged to this category. In the case of books and book chapters (from 7% in Chemical & 
Material Sciences to 19% in Humanities, Literature & Ads), conference proceedings (especially in 
Engineering & Computer Science: 12%), and unpublished materials such as preprints (11% in Business, 
Economics & Management, and 12% in Physics and Mathematics), the results are closer to those found 
by previous studies. The results also show a predominance of English for the citing sources, 
followed by Chinese (4%-12% depending on the source). These are similar to the results in Kousha & 
Thelwall (2008) in that Chinese is the second most used language in the sample of citations, 
although their study found very different percentages (approx. 35% in Biology, 25% in Chemistry, 
and less than 5% in Physics and Computing).

Lastly, the citation correlations between GS and WoS range from .78 in Literature, to .98 in Basic 
Life Sciences, Biomedical Sciences, Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, and Multidisciplinary 
journals, and the correlations between GS and Scopus range from .92 to .99. These correlations are 
similar to some in previous studies (Amara & Landry, 2012; Delgado Lépez-Cézar et al., 2018; 
Martin-Martin et al., 2018; Minasny et al., 2013) but somewhat stronger than the ones found by 
others (De Groote & Raszewski, 2012; Kousha & Thelwall, 2007; Meho & Yang, 2007; Moed et al., 2016; 
Pauly & Stergiou, 2005; Rahimi & Chandrakumar, 2014; Wildgaard, 2015). This may be due to the 
disciplines of previous studies or the use of more recent data in the current paper.

5. Conclusions
This study provides evidence that GS finds significantly more citations than the WoS Core 
Collection and Scopus across all subject areas. Nearly all citations found by WoS (95%) and Scopus 
(92%) were also found by GS, which found a substantial amount of unique citations that were not 
found by the other databases. In the Humanities, Literature & Arts, Social Sciences, and Business, 
Economics & Management, unique GS citations surpass 50% of all citations in the area.

About half (48%-65%, depending on the area) of GS unique citations are not from journals but are 
theses/dissertations, books or book chapters, conference proceedings, unpublished materials (such 
as preprints), and other document types. These unique citations are primarily written in English, 
although a significant minority (19%-38% depending on the area) are in other languages. The 
scientific impact of these unique citations themselves is, on average, much lower than that of 
citations also found by WoS or Scopus, suggesting that the GS coverage advantage is mostly for low 
impact documents. Taken together, these results suggest caution if using GS instead of WoS or 
Scopus for citation evaluations. Without evidence, it cannot be assumed that the higher citation 
counts of GS are always superior to those of WoS and Scopus, since it is possible that the 
inclusion of lower quality citing documents reduces the extent to which citation counts reflect 
scholarly impact. For example, some of the citations from Master's theses may reflect educational 
impact. Therefore, depending on the type of evaluation that needs to be carried out, it might be 
necessary to remove certain types of citing documents from the citation counts, as suggested by 
Prins et al. (2016).

Spearman correlations between GS and WoS, and GS and Scopus citation counts are very strong across 
all subject categories but weaker in the Humanities (GS-WoS, Literature: .78) and Engineering 
(GS-WoS, Electrical Engineering and Telecommunication: .83). Also, correlations between GS and WoS 
(.78 to .98) are weaker than between GS and Scopus (.92 to .99). The weakest correlations are in 
the categories where there is a greater difference between the citation counts provided by GS, and 
the citation counts provided by WoS/Scopus. Thus, if GS is used for research evaluations then its 
data would be unlikely to produce large changes in the results, despite the additional citations 
found. It would be particularly useful when there is reason to believe that documents not covered 
by WoS or Scopus are important for an evaluation.



20

In conclusion, this study gives the first systematic evidence to confirm prior speculation 
(Harzing, 2013; Martin-Martin et al., 2018; Mingers & Lipitakis, 2010; Prins et al., 2016) that 
citation data in GS has reached a high level of comprehensiveness, because the gaps of coverage in 
GS found by the earliest studies that analysed GS data have now been filled. It surpasses WoS and 
Scopus numerically in all areas of research, and is greatly superior in the areas where WoS and 
Scopus have a poor coverage, including the Social Sciences and Humanities. However, at this point 
there is no reliable and scalable method to extract data from GS, and the metadata offered by the 
platform is still very limited, reducing the practical suitability of this source for large-scale 
citation analyses, although manual data collection is possible for small scale uses. Nevertheless, 
providing that a reliable method to extract citation data can be found, the lack of metadata could 
be solved by combining GS citation data with rich openly accessible data, such as that provided by 
CrossRef.
